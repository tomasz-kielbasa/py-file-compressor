# Python file compressor

## Usage

Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run app
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Results

We achieve about 10x compression using 1.1B model. Compressing 100 lines file takes around 10s on GPU.

## Miscellaneous

Work inspired by [Language Modeling Is Compression](https://aps.arxiv.org/abs/2309.10668)
